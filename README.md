# ⚙️ Data Engineering Lab

### 🎯 Overview
This repository demonstrates **scalable data engineering practices** through reproducible and hands-on projects.  
It focuses on building **robust, automated, and modular data pipelines** that form the foundation for modern analytics and AI.

Projects in this lab explore patterns in:
- Data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration  
- Metadata-driven automation and CI/CD for pipelines  
- Cloud data architecture and warehouse design  
- Testing, monitoring, and optimization in data workflows
